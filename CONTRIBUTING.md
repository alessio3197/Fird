### Coding guidelines

First, be sure to familiarise yourself with the style guide.

### Merging with dev or master

Master and dev are protected branches. This means that you cannot push to it directly. Instead, you will need to make your own 
branch and then submit a pull request when you want it merged.

### Code reviews

Pull requests are accepted once they have gone through a code review process. For changes that do not involve code, such as 
changes to the README, style guide or the UI elements of the game will still need to be reviewed.
